# Restaurant Recommender
Restaurant Recommendation App Built In Kotlin

# Project Instructions
## Introduction
This project will serve several purposes. It will:

- Provide the opportunity to think creatively about a software product for an interesting or novel use.
- Give you the freedom to make all decisions about the development environment and plan for development
- Give you experience in "pitching" a concept

## Background:
Assume you work for a small software company that is looking for new products. As part of this activity, you must decide what type of software your company makes, specify the domain in which your company works (anything from mobile games to secure web apps to real-time systems) and operate under that assumption. The company has created several teams and tasked you with creating a "proof of concept" for a new software capability within the overall boundaries of what your posited company does. You are also required to identify the programming language and development environment that would be used to develop the software, to justify why it is a good choice, and to use it to develop your demo.

You will first develop a project plan that will specify the key aspects of your project as listed below. You will implement the plan throughout the semester at your own pace, but hopefully, according to the schedule you specify. This work will culminate in the development of a software demo you will use to make a pitch for your software idea during the last week of class.

## Project Plan 
Your project plan must specify concisely:
- the domain in which you are creating software
- the actual software you are building
- a development language and development environment
- a rough schedule

## Teams
This project will involve work on teams of four people. 

## Implementation
Since the project will only be of a few months duration, you have other software to develop for this class, and the idea is to create a basic proof of concept, you may certainly "dummy up" aspects of the program. For instance, you might not implement actual database connectivity. You can hardcode a capability to show how a typical query might be made and to display its results. If your program is compute-intensive, you might focus on implementation of a specific critical algorithm to prove that implementing this functionality is feasible.

## Project Evaluation Document
You will produce a brief (one page at most) document at the end of your project in which you will comment on
- the novelty of your idea
- the appropriateness of the chosen language and environment for development

## Presentation
We will have 10 teams in the class. You will have approximately 15 minutes to pitch your idea and to show your demo to the class during the last week of the semester. This activity will give you more experience working virtually, which is likely to be an ongoing work mode even when we get past COVID-19.

## Presentation policies
1. Make sure everyone in the group has a working microphone or access to one via another group member. As mentioned in the project description, everyone is expected to present.
2. Each group will have a single designated "page turner."  I will make that person the presenter. This person will share his or her desktop to run the presentation and any demos you might have. Obviously, this person will forward through the pages of the presentation at the proper time.
3. When you present. The first speaker should clearly announce his or her name. When she or he is done, s/he should state the name of the next person to speak. As the new speaker starts, she or he should repeat his or her name. Much as I would hate to do it, I **WILL** interrupt you to ask your name if I do not know who is talking.

## Grading
The project will be graded on the basis of the interestingness of your idea, the appearance of having put real effort into the development of your prototype, how convincing your pitch is, and completeness of your submission (eg: inclusion of your project plan and evaluation).
Deliverables

You will submit the following by the close date and time for project 5:

- project plan
- project evaluation document
- presentation materials (if any)
- source code
- executable code (if separate from source code)
- any other deliverables associated with the project
